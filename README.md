# Global Temperature Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes global land and ocean temperature data spanning from 1760 to 2015. It uses C programming for data processing and calculations, and GNUPlot for generating visualizations. The project showcases various temperature trends and insights through statistical computations and graphical representations.

## **Technologies Used**  

- **C Programming**:  
  - Handles data parsing, computations, and output generation.  
  - Implements statistical methods to calculate yearly, monthly, and century averages.
  - Generates data files for plotting with GNUPlot.

- **GNUPlot**:  
  - Produces graphical outputs, including line plots, bar plots, and error bar graphs.  
  - Visualizes temperature trends across different timeframes and categories.  

- **CSV File Handling**:  
  - Parses the provided dataset for temperature data.  
  - Automates data processing without manual intervention.  

## **Features**  

1. Computes yearly average temperatures (1760–2015).  
2. Calculates average land temperatures for the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.  
3. Determines monthly averages across all years (1900–2015).  
4. Identifies the hottest and coldest months and years in the dataset.  
5. Generates detailed visualizations for:  
   - Yearly temperature trends.  
   - Comparative trends between centuries.  
   - Yearly averages of land minimum, maximum, and average temperatures.  
   - Monthly temperatures with error bars for uncertainties.
